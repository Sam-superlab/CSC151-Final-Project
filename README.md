## Project Description

## How to contribute (using git)

Git is a version control system that allows multiple people to work on the same project. This is a quick guide on how to use git to contribute to this project.

### Cloning the repository

To get a copy of the project on your local machine, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Sam-superlab/CSC151-Final-Project
```

### Creating a branch

Before making changes, create a new branch:
```
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

### Committing your changes

After making changes, commit them with a comment:
```
git commit -m "your comment here"
```

### Pushing your changes

Push your changes to the GitHub repository:
```
git push origin your-branch-name
```

If it fails, probably because you are not up-to-date with the main branch, pull the changes from the main branch:
```
git pull origin main
```
Resolve any conflicts, then push your changes again:
```
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### Creating a pull request

Once your changes are pushed, create a pull request on GitHub by clicking the "New pull request" button. Select the branch you want to merge and create the pull request. Assign someone to review and merge your changes to the main branch.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
