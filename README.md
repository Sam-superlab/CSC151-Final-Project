Why Use Git?

Git is a powerful version control system that enables:
	1.	Collaboration: Easily share and manage contributions from multiple team members.
	2.	Version Tracking: Keep a history of changes to your project, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed.
	3.	Branching: Experiment with new features or fixes without affecting the main project until you’re ready.
	4.	Backup: Secure your work by storing it in the cloud on platforms like GitHub.

By using Git, this project remains organized, transparent, and robust.
